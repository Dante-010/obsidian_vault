> [!abstract] Abstracto original
>  Community detection techniques are useful for social media plat- forms to discover tightly connected groups of users who share common interests. However, this functionality often comes at the expense of potentially exposing individuals to privacy breaches by inadvertently revealing their tastes or preferences. Therefore, some users may wish to preserve their anonymity and opt out of community detection for various reasons, such as affiliation with political or religious organizations, without leaving the platform. In this study, we address the challenge of community membership hiding, which involves strategically altering the structural proper- ties of a network graph to prevent one or more nodes from being identified by a given community detection algorithm. We tackle this problem by formulating it as a constrained counterfactual graph ob- jective, and we solve it via deep reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines, striking the best balance between accuracy and cost.

> The core challenge of this problem lies in determining how to strategically modify the structural properties of a network graph, effectively excluding one or more nodes from being identified by a given community detection algorithm.

### Alternativas posibles

#### Introducidas en el paper

> However, the community deception task, as defined by Fionda and Pirr√≤ [8] , does not have a binary outcome, unlike our community membership hiding goal. Instead, the authors intro- duce a smooth measure, the Deception Score, that combines three criteria for effective community masking: reachability, spreadness, and hiding. While it might seem plausible to extend our method for community deception by running multiple membership hiding tasks for each node in the target community, this straightforward strategy might be too aggressive due to our more stringent (i.e., binary) definition of deception goal. A more nuanced approach could involve leveraging the structural properties of each node in the community to mask (e.g., their degree) to cleverly select target nodes for membership hiding. Further exploration of this strategy is left for future research.

Hacemos el approach "naive" que realiza varias membership hiding tasks para cada nodo, y el approach m√°s optimizado de considerar las propiedades estructurales de los nodos para elegir los m√°s indicados.

Tenemos que adaptar el algoritmo para poder trabajar con overlapping communities (ver [[Variables, par√°metros y ecuaciones]]).

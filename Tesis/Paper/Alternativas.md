> However, the community deception task, as defined by Fionda and Pirr√≤ [8] , does not have a binary outcome, unlike our community membership hiding goal. Instead, the authors introduce a smooth measure, the Deception Score, that combines three criteria for effective community masking: reachability, spreadness, and hiding. While it might seem plausible to extend our method for community deception by running multiple membership hiding tasks for each node in the target community, this straightforward strategy might be too aggressive due to our more stringent (i.e., binary) definition of deception goal. A more nuanced approach could involve leveraging the structural properties of each node in the community to mask (e.g., their degree) to cleverly select target nodes for membership hiding. Further exploration of this strategy is left for future research.

Hacemos el approach "naive" que realiza varias membership hiding tasks para cada nodo, y el approach m√°s optimizado de considerar las propiedades estructurales de los nodos para elegir los m√°s indicados.

> Alternatively, one may opt to enforce specific changes, ensuring that the target node ùë¢ no longer shares the same community with some nodes. For example, if Cùëñ = {ùë†, ùë°, ùë¢, ùë£, ùë§, ùë•, ùë¶, ùëß}, we might wish to assign ùë¢ to a new community C‚Ä≤ ùëñ such that ùë†, ùë§, ùëß ‚àâ C‚Ä≤ ùëñ . In this work, we adopt the first definition, leaving exploration of other possibilities for future research.

Elegimos algunos nodos y redefinimos el objetivo final, que implica que el nodo objetivo no comparta comunidad con ciertos nodos.

> ...standard optimization methods like stochastic gradient descent are unsuitable for this task. One potential solution is to smooth the loss function using numerical techniques, such as applying a real-valued perturbation matrix to the original graph‚Äôs adjacency matrix like in \[23 , 40\]. Another option is to directly define $‚Ñì_{\text{decept}}$ as a smooth similarity between the original and the newly obtained community, sacrificing control over the threshold ùúè. We leave the exploration of these alternatives for future work.

> Moreover, in a real-world scenario, multiple nodes may require concealment independently. There is a risk that modifications aiding the concealment of one node might hinder another‚Äôs, potentially reducing the overall success rate. This issue arises when the nodes to be hidden share non-trivial neighborhood overlaps. To address this, we propose extending our framework to handle node sets rather than individuals, akin to a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem. Each agent, representing a node, collaborates to achieve their hiding objectives.

> In future work, we aim to explore different definitions of community membership hiding and incorporate node feature modifications alongside structural alterations to the counterfactual graph objective. Furthermore, we plan to apply our method to extremely large network graphs. Finally, we will generalize our method to address the community deception task or scenarios where multiple users simultaneously request node membership hiding.

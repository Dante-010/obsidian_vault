> [!abstract] Abstracto original
>  Community detection techniques are useful for social media plat- forms to discover tightly connected groups of users who share common interests. However, this functionality often comes at the expense of potentially exposing individuals to privacy breaches by inadvertently revealing their tastes or preferences. Therefore, some users may wish to preserve their anonymity and opt out of community detection for various reasons, such as affiliation with political or religious organizations, without leaving the platform. In this study, we address the challenge of community membership hiding, which involves strategically altering the structural proper- ties of a network graph to prevent one or more nodes from being identified by a given community detection algorithm. We tackle this problem by formulating it as a constrained counterfactual graph ob- jective, and we solve it via deep reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines, striking the best balance between accuracy and cost.

> The core challenge of this problem lies in determining how to strategically modify the structural properties of a network graph, effectively excluding one or more nodes from being identified by a given community detection algorithm.

#### Introducidas en el paper

> However, the community deception task, as defined by Fionda and Pirr√≤ [8] , does not have a binary outcome, unlike our community membership hiding goal. Instead, the authors introduce a smooth measure, the Deception Score, that combines three criteria for effective community masking: reachability, spreadness, and hiding. While it might seem plausible to extend our method for community deception by running multiple membership hiding tasks for each node in the target community, this straightforward strategy might be too aggressive due to our more stringent (i.e., binary) definition of deception goal. A more nuanced approach could involve leveraging the structural properties of each node in the community to mask (e.g., their degree) to cleverly select target nodes for membership hiding. Further exploration of this strategy is left for future research.

> Alternatively, one may opt to enforce specific changes, ensuring that the target node ùë¢ no longer shares the same community with some nodes. For example, if Cùëñ = {ùë†, ùë°, ùë¢, ùë£, ùë§, ùë•, ùë¶, ùëß}, we might wish to assign ùë¢ to a new community C‚Ä≤ ùëñ such that ùë†, ùë§, ùëß ‚àâ C‚Ä≤ ùëñ . In this work, we adopt the first definition, leaving exploration of other possibilities for future research.

> ...standard optimization methods like stochastic gradient descent are unsuitable for this task. One potential solution is to smooth the loss function using numerical techniques, such as applying a real-valued perturbation matrix to the original graph‚Äôs adjacency matrix like in [23 , 40]. Another option is to directly define $‚Ñì_{\text{decept}}$ as a smooth similarity between the original and the newly obtained community, sacrificing control over the threshold ùúè. We leave the exploration of these alternatives for future work.

> Moreover, in a real-world scenario, multiple nodes may require concealment independently. There is a risk that modifications aid- ing the concealment of one node might hinder another‚Äôs, potentially reducing the overall success rate. This issue arises when the nodes to be hidden share non-trivial neighborhood overlaps. To address this, we propose extending our framework to handle node sets rather than individuals, akin to a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem. Each agent, representing a node, collaborates to achieve their hiding objectives.

> In future work, we aim to explore different definitions of commu- nity membership hiding and incorporate node feature modifications alongside structural alterations to the counterfactual graph objec- tive. Furthermore, we plan to apply our method to extremely large network graphs. Finally, we will generalize our method to address the community deception task or scenarios where multiple users simultaneously request node membership hiding.
